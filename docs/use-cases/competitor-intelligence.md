# Competitive Intelligence

Understand a competitor’s product strategy by "X-raying" their website.

## Strategy Snapshots
A massive cluster around a new "Enterprise Features" section on a competitor's site tells you exactly where they are investing their R&D.

## Messaging Comparison
Use the [RAG Chatbot](../features/rag-chatbot.md) to compare the value propositions across different clusters of a competitor's site versus your own.

## Real-Time Change Alerts
Identify when a competitor adds a new major section to their navigation bar, signaling a shift in their business model.
