# Legal & Regulatory Compliance

Legal sites—government portals, privacy policies, and terms of service—are notoriously difficult to navigate.

## Statute Mapping
Map out complex regulatory frameworks. For example, scraping a state's compliance website to see how different sections of the law interconnect.

## Real-Time "Freshness"
Unlike an LLM with a 2024 cutoff, DocWeb pulls the live version of the law. A lawyer can ask, "What is the current requirement for X under the 2026 update?" and receive an answer grounded in today's data via the [RAG Chatbot](../features/rag-chatbot.md).

## Document Summarization
Use the AI assistant to summarize long-form legal documents without the risk of "hallucinating" a clause that doesn't exist.
