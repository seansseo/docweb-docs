# Technical Documentation

DocWeb was originally designed to solve the "lost in the docs" problem for engineers.

## Rapid Onboarding
Instead of a linear reading list, new hires get a visual "Knowledge Map." They can see the core [Architecture](../core-concepts/architecture.md) (larger nodes) and how utility modules (smaller clusters) branch off.

## Visualizing Dependencies
Map out how different parts of an API relate to each other using our [graph visualization](../features/visualization.md).

## Deep Dive Troubleshooting
Ask the [RAG Chatbot](../features/rag-chatbot.md) a specific question, and the graph will zoom directly to the relevant documentation cluster while the AI provides code snippets.
