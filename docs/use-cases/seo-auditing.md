# SEO & Website Architecture

SEO professionals often look at spreadsheets of URLs; DocWeb turns that data into a visual "Link Equity" map.

## Siloing & Internal Linking
Visualize the hierarchy of a site to ensure search engine bots (and users) can find important pages. You can instantly spot "Content Orphans"—pages that exist but aren't connected to the main structure.

## Visualizing Click Depth
Easily see how many "hops" it takes to get from the homepage to a high-value product page in the [Sigma.js Visualization](../features/visualization.md).

## Redirect & Error Identification
Nodes can be color-coded to show 404 errors or redirect loops within the map.
