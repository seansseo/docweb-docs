# URL Classification

To ensure the [Visualization](../features/visualization.md) is meaningful, DocWeb automatically categorizes pages.

## Categories
- **Primary Content**: The core documentation pages.
- **Support Documents**: FAQs, troubleshooting, and guides.
- **Utility Pages**: Search, login, and legal footers (often filtered out or minimized).

## Why it Matters
By classifying URLs, we can apply different visual styles in the graph. Root nodes are larger and brighter, while utility pages are kept small to avoid cluttering the [Neural Layout](../features/visualization.md#neural-layout).

This classification is a critical part of our [Intelligent Discovery](waterfall-discovery.md) engine.
