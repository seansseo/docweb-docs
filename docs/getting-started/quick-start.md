# Quick Start

Get your first "Neural Map" up and running in minutes.

## Step 1: Sign In

1. Open [docweb.net](https://docweb.net) in your browser
2. Sign in with **Email/Password** or **Google OAuth**
3. You'll start with **3 free credits per day** on the Free tier

## Step 2: Discover a Documentation Site

1. Enter a URL of a documentation site you want to visualize (e.g., `https://docs.stripe.com`)
2. Click **"Discover"** to start the [Waterfall Discovery](../core-concepts/waterfall-discovery.md) process
3. DocWeb will:
   - Fetch and parse `robots.txt` and sitemaps
   - Crawl navigation elements for structural links
   - Classify and cluster all discovered URLs

## Step 3: Explore the Graph

Use the [Sigma.js Visualization](../features/visualization.md) to explore your documentation:

- **Zoom & Pan**: Navigate through the neural graph
- **Click Clusters**: Focus on specific topic areas (API, Guides, etc.)
- **Hover Nodes**: See page titles and metadata
- **Cluster Hulls**: Visual boundaries show topic groupings

## Step 4: Chat with Dex

Open the **chatbot panel** to interact with **Dex**, your AI documentation assistant:

- Ask questions like "How do I authenticate API requests?"
- Dex uses [hybrid search](../features/rag-chatbot.md#hybrid-search) to find relevant content
- Responses include **source citations** with clickable links
- View **Dex's thinking steps** to see how answers were derived

## Step 5: Manage Sessions

Your discoveries are saved as **sessions** in the left sidebar:

- Switch between multiple documentation sites
- Sessions persist across browser sessions
- Upgrade to **Pro** or **Max** tier for more sessions and credits

## Credit Usage
