# Getting Started

Welcome to DocWeb, the visual intelligence platform for digital content.

DocWeb is an information visualization platform designed to turn complex website documentation into an interactive "neural web." Instead of scrolling and clicking through endless links and pages, users can see the entire structure of a website at once, exploring clusters of information through a high-performance graph.

## The Problem
Modern technical documentation is often vast and fragmented. Users struggle to understand how topics relate to one another or where a specific piece of information fits into the "big picture." DocWeb maps this data visually, making discovery intuitive and lightning-fast.

## The Solution
DocWeb provides "Just-in-Time" intelligence rather than "Static" knowledge by crawling live sites and using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to provide grounded, hallucination-free answers.
