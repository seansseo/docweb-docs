# Content Extraction

DocWeb's ability to extract and understand content is what powers the [RAG Chatbot](rag-chatbot.md).

## Markdown Scrape
We focus on extracting clean Markdown from documentation sites. This format is ideal for AI processing and maintains the structure of the original content.

## Deep Dives
When a user triggers a "Deep Dive" on a cluster in the [Visualization](visualization.md), DocWeb performs a targeted scrape of those specific pages, indexing them for immediate use by the AI.

## Intelligent Filtering
Using [URL Classification](../core-concepts/url-classification.md), we ensure that only relevant content is extracted, saving time and resources.
