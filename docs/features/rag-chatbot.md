# RAG Chatbot

The future of DocWeb is an AI assistant that truly understands your documentation.

## Ask Your Docs
Instead of searching for a keyword, you can ask the chatbot complex questions like "How do I implement X using Y?"

## Contextual Awareness
The AI uses the [Sigma.js Visualization](visualization.md) structure and scraped markdown content to provide accurate, source-backed answers.

## Smart Navigation
Soon, you'll be able to tell the AI to "Show me all pages related to Authentication," and the graph will automatically zoom and highlight those nodes for you.

## Grounded in Reality
By using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the chatbot is limited to the data found during [Discovery](../core-concepts/waterfall-discovery.md), eliminating hallucinations.
